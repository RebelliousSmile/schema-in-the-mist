# Schema in the Mist

Open, versioned data schemas for **Mist Engine** games (**City of Mist**, **:Otherscape**, and **Legend in the Mist**) so VTTs, builders, and other digital tools can **share the same data**.

The aim is an ecosystem of interoperable digital tools where they can exchange structured JSON/TOML, validate it via schemas (e.g., using Zod), and leverage it for their specific needs.

## What’s in here

- `src/zod/` contains the source Zod v4 definitions
- `schemas/` contains the generated JSON Schemas
- `appearance/game-pack.schema.json` describes a game pack, the cross-game
  presentation vocabulary a Mist Engine game is styled with — no shared field
  with the content schemas above, so it publishes at the repository root
  rather than under `schemas/`
- `examples/` contains JSON/TOML examples per schema
- `tools/` provides generation and validation scripts: `gen-schemas.ts` and
  `validate-examples.ts` check each document against its schema;
  `validate-references.ts` (`npm run validate:refs`) checks what a schema
  cannot — identity uniqueness and cross-file references, such as a
  Character Trope's Theme Kit picks

## Using the schemas in your tool

### Use Zod directly (TS apps)

If you use TypeScript and Zod parsing, you can copy/paste the provided Zod schemas:

```ts
import { LegendInTheMistChallengeSchema } from "./src/zod/legend-in-the-mist/challenge";
const parsed = LegendInTheMistChallengeSchema.parse(userInputJson);
```

### Validate data (language-agnostic)

Use any JSON Schema validator (AJV, Python jsonschema, Rust jsonschema). Example with AJV:

```ts
import fs from "node:fs";
import Ajv from "ajv";
import addFormats from "ajv-formats";

const schema = JSON.parse(
  fs.readFileSync("schemas/legend-in-the-mist/challenge.schema.json", "utf8")
);

const ajv = new Ajv({ allErrors: true, strict: false });
addFormats(ajv);
const validate = ajv.compile(schema);

const data = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync("path/to/challenge.json", "utf8"));
if (!validate(data)) console.error(validate.errors);
```

### Editor autocomplete for JSON and TOML

Depending on your code editor, you can configure custom JSON Schemas for both JSON and TOML files. For JSON specifically, you can also put a `$schema` hint at the top:

```json
{
  "$schema": "./schemas/legend-in-the-mist/challenge.schema.json",
  "name": "Boggart",
  "rating": 2
}
```
