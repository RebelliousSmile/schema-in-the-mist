# Schema in the Mist

Open, versioned data schemas for **Mist Engine** games (**City of Mist**, **:Otherscape**, and **Legend in the Mist**) so VTTs, builders, and other digital tools can **share the same data**.

The aim is an ecosystem of interoperable digital tools where they can exchange structured JSON/TOML, validate it via schemas (e.g., using Zod), and leverage it for their specific needs.

## What’s in here

- `src/zod/` contains the source Zod v4 definitions
- `schemas/` contains the generated JSON Schemas
- `examples/` contains JSON/TOML examples per schema
- `tools/` provides generation and validation scripts

### Content schemas and appearance packs

The game folders — `city-of-mist/`, `legend-in-the-mist/`, `otherscape/` —
describe **what is played**: Dangers, Challenges, Journeys, Theme Kits. They are
written by a Narrator and read by any tool that shows them.

The cross-game `game-pack` appearance contract now lives in
[`RebelliousSmile/schema-appearance`](https://github.com/RebelliousSmile/schema-appearance).
New consumers should read its [canonical Draft 7 schema](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RebelliousSmile/schema-appearance/main/schemas/appearance/game-pack.schema.json).

For compatibility, this repository retains frozen, self-contained copies at
[`appearance/game-pack.schema.json`](./appearance/game-pack.schema.json) and
[`schemas/appearance/game-pack.schema.json`](./schemas/appearance/game-pack.schema.json).
They require no network-aware `$ref` resolver, but they are deprecated and will
not receive future contract changes. Their removal requires a separately
approved breaking release.

## Using the schemas in your tool

### Use Zod directly (TS apps)

If you use TypeScript and Zod parsing, you can copy/paste the provided Zod schemas:

```ts
import { LegendInTheMistChallengeSchema } from "./src/zod/legend-in-the-mist/challenge";
const parsed = LegendInTheMistChallengeSchema.parse(userInputJson);
```

### Validate data (language-agnostic)

Use any JSON Schema validator (AJV, Python jsonschema, Rust jsonschema). Example with AJV:

```ts
import fs from "node:fs";
import Ajv from "ajv";
import addFormats from "ajv-formats";

const schema = JSON.parse(
  fs.readFileSync("schemas/legend-in-the-mist/challenge.schema.json", "utf8")
);

const ajv = new Ajv({ allErrors: true, strict: false });
addFormats(ajv);
const validate = ajv.compile(schema);

const data = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync("path/to/challenge.json", "utf8"));
if (!validate(data)) console.error(validate.errors);
```

### Editor autocomplete for JSON and TOML

Depending on your code editor, you can configure custom JSON Schemas for both JSON and TOML files. For JSON specifically, you can also put a `$schema` hint at the top:

```json
{
  "$schema": "./schemas/legend-in-the-mist/challenge.schema.json",
  "name": "Boggart",
  "rating": 2
}
```
